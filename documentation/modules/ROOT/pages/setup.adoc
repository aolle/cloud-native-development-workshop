[#devspaces]
=== Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces

You can use the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console to install Red Hat OpenShift DevSpaces by following these steps:

* Open a browser window and log in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

* From the Administrator perspective, click on `Operators` and then select `OperatorHub`.

* In the `Filter by keyword` field, type `devspaces`.

* On the Install Operator page, select `stable` from the list of available Update Channel options, and then choose `All namespaces on the cluster (default)`. Leave the default value of Installed Namespace as `openshift-operators(Operator recommended)`, and set the Update Approval to Automatic.

* Click `Install`.

Once the operator installation finishes, create a project named `demo-devspaces` and deploy a `CheCluster` by following these steps:

* From the Administrator perspective, click on `Installed Operators`.
* Select `Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces`.

* Click on `Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces instance Specification`, select `Current namespace only` and then click on `Create CheCluster`.

* Set a desired name for the CheCluster, for example `devspaces`, and click on `Create`.

* Wait for the `CheCluster` deployment to finish. When it's available, navigate to `Networking`, then `Routes`, and open the devspaces route.

If the `DevSpaces` dashboard loads correctly, it means that the installation process went without any issues.

[#cicd]
=== CI/CD Environment

In this section, we will deploy all the components of the CI/CD environment. The environment is composed of a Gitea git server, a Sonatype Nexus and a SonarQube server.

We have an existing Spring application that we want to migrate to Quarkus because we are interested in taking the advantatge of the benefits provided by the supersonic subatomic Java framework!

We will be working with a modififed, prepared, and adapted version of the `CI/CD Demo with Tekton and Argo CD on OpenShift`, created by Siamak Sadeghianfar and contributors. The original repository is available [here](https://github.com/siamaksade/openshift-cicd-demo).

However, for this workshop, we will be using a version available [here](https://github.com/aolle/openshift-cicd-demo/tree/cnd), soecifically in the `cnd` branch.

To install the CI/CD environment, simply clone that branch and proceed as follows:

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
git clone -b cnd https://github.com/aolle/openshift-cicd-demo.git
./openshift-cicd-demo/demo.sh install
----

NOTE: Make sure that you have already logged in into your OpenShift cluster before executing the commands. Additionally, make a note of the URLs of the services that the installation script provides.

Verify that the environment has been installed without any issues by opening the different URLs and checking the login and the landing pages. Check that we have two repositories avabilable in Gitea: quarkus-petclinic and quarkus-petclinic-config.

IMPORTANT: The list of the default credentials (username / password) is as follows:
Gitea: gitea / openshift | Sonatype Nexus: admin / admin123 | SonarQube: admin / admin | Argo CD: __login with OpenShift credentials__
