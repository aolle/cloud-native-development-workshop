=== Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces

You can use the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console to install Red Hat OpenShift DevSpaces by following these steps:

* Open a browser window and log in to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform web console.

* From the Administrator perspective, click on `Operators` and then select `OperatorHub`.

* In the `Filter by keyword` field, type `devspaces`.

* On the Install Operator page, select `stable` from the list of available Update Channel options, and then choose `All namespaces on the cluster (default)`. Leave the default value of Installed Namespace as `openshift-operators(Operator recommended)`, and set the Update Approval to Automatic.

Once the operator installation finishes, create a project named `demo-devspaces` and deploy a `CheCluster` by following these steps:

* From the Administrator perspective, click on `Installed Operators`.
* Select `Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces`.

* Set a desired name for the CheCluster, for example `devspaces`, and click on `Create`.

* Wait for the `CheCluster` deployment to finish. When it's available, navigate to `Networking`, then `Routes`, and open the devspaces route.

If the `DevSpaces` dashboard loads correctly, it means that the installation process went without any issues.
